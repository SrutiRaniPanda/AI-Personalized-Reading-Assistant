            "value": "“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!”\n\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better oﬀ he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.”\n\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”\n\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\n\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least ﬁve times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”\n\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully oﬀ the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”\n\n“No problems, were there?”\n\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was ﬂyin’ over Bristol.”\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”\n\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”\n\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.\n\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!”\n\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry oﬀ ter live with Muggles —”\n\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n“Well,” said Dumbledore ﬁnally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”\n\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muﬄed voice, “I’d best get this bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and oﬀ into the night.\n\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruﬄed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”\n\n"

These people will never <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">understand</span> him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">surprised</span> if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!”\n\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">seriously</span> over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">remember</span>! Can’t you see how much better oﬀ he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">swallowed</span>, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">suddenly</span> as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n“Hagrid’s <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">bringing</span> him.”\n\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">important</span> as this?”\n\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\n\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">grudgingly</span>, “but you can’t pretend he’s not <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">careless</span>. He does tend to — what was that?”\n\nA low <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">rumbling</span> sound had broken the silence around them. It grew <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">steadily</span> louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">headlight</span>; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">motorcycle</span> fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">motorcycle</span> was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least ﬁve times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">dolphins</span>. In his vast, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">muscular</span> arms he was holding a bundle of <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">blankets</span>.\n\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">sounding</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">relieved</span>. “At last. And where did you get that <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">motorcycle</span>?”\n\n“<span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">Borrowed</span> it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">climbing</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">carefully</span> oﬀ the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">motorcycle</span> as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”\n\n“No <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">problems</span>, were there?”\n\n“No, sir — house was almost <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">destroyed</span>, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was ﬂyin’ over Bristol.”\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">blankets</span>. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">forehead</span> they could see a <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">curiously</span> shaped cut, like a bolt of <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">lightning</span>.\n\n“Is that where — ?” <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">whispered</span> Professor McGonagall.\n\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”\n\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”\n\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.\n\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">scratchy</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">whiskery</span> kiss. Then, <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">suddenly</span>, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!”\n\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">handkerchief</span> and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry oﬀ ter live with Muggles —”\n\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">whispered</span>, patting Hagrid <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">gingerly</span> on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">doorstep</span>, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">blankets</span>, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">shoulders</span> shook, Professor McGonagall blinked <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">furiously</span>, and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">twinkling</span> light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n“Well,” said Dumbledore ﬁnally, “that’s that. We’ve no <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">business</span> staying here. We may as well go and join the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">celebrations</span>.”\n\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muﬄed voice, “I’d best get this bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”\n\nWiping his <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">streaming</span> eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">motorcycle</span> and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and oﬀ into the night.\n\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">suddenly</span> orange and he could make out a tabby cat <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">slinking</span> around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">blankets</span> on the step of number four.\n\n“Good luck, Harry,” he <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">murmured</span>. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruﬄed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">astonishing</span> things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: red; font-weight: bold;\">blankets</span> without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”</div>"
